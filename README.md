emscript
=========

EmScript is the Eclipse plugin for BMC Control-M/Enterprise Manager 8. Currently it is at the (very) early version but can be useful if you need to (re-)edit Control-M XML files. Due to limitation of the official Control-M's Java API (and Web Service Interface also), the plugin uses Control-M utitiles (which usually reside in the bin folder of the Control-M/Enterprise Manager). The utilities are required for the XML Import/Export.
