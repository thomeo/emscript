emscript
=========

EmScript is Eclipse feature/plugin for BMC Control-M/Enterprise Manager 8. Currently it is a (very) early version of the plugin and can be useful if you need to (re-)edit Control-M XML files. Due to limitation of the official Control-M's Java API (and Web Service Interface also), the plugin uses Control-M utitiles (which usually reside in the bin folder of the Control-M/Enterprise Manager). They are required for the XML Import/Export.
